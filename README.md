# 📚 CS50SQL Problem Sets Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [CS50's Introduction to Databases with SQL](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/) course. Here, you'll find:

- 📝 **Problem Set Solutions**: Each week's problem set is solved and documented in Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) and corresponding SQL files.
- 🏆 **Final Project**: My completed final project for the course.
- 💡 **Lecture Queries**: Example queries demonstrated in lectures, provided as notebooks.

- 📂 Each problem set folder contains both Jupyter notebooks and raw SQL files for every question.
- 🗄️ Databases (`.db`) are included for local testing and exploration.
- 🧩 The `template.ipynb` notebook provides a starting point for new queries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**  
   See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) or [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) for required Python packages.  
   Recommended:  
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Open Notebooks**  
   Use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) to open and run the `.ipynb` files.

3. **Run SQL Files**  
   You can execute the SQL files directly against the provided SQLite databases using the command line or a database browser.
